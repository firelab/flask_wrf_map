This directory holds data coming from diablo

most importantly is the wrfSim/ directory

In wrfSim/ are all the files kml files that are displayed under
weather.firelab.org/wrf.html

Becuase we aren't really using it at this point, I have disabled updating 

wrfSim/ninjaout/ which used to hold all the raw kmz files for users who 

wanted them.

To re-enable this, go to diablo and under the tfinney crontab

locate the cronjob with comment RAW Ninja Out files

re enable this, and all the raw kmzs will get copied over again

Also disabled are the raw temperature grids, this was done once again to conserve space

on breezy

to re-enable this go to the diable crontab and enable the cronjob with comment RAW Temperature grids
